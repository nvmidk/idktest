                    <h1>About Wonder Egg Priority</h1>
                    <p>Wonder Egg Priority is a Japanese anime series that follows the story 
                        of Ai Ohto, a high school girl who is grappling with the suicide of 
                        her best friend. One day, she is given a mysterious egg that transports
                        her to a strange and fantastical world where she is tasked with saving
                        the souls of young girls who have died. Along with her three other
                        egg companions, Neiru, Rika, and Momoe, Ai faces a series of challenges 
                        and battles against monsters known as "Seeno Evils" in order to save 
                        these girls and uncover the truth behind their deaths. 
                        As the series progresses, the girls also confront their own personal
                         demons and traumas, leading to a poignant exploration of mental health and grief.</p>
